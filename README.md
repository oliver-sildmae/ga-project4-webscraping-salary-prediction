## GA Project 4 - Web scraping data from Indeed.com to predict salaries  
The aim of this project is primarily to practise web scraping data to be used for analysis.

Data science job listings for 16 large US cities were scraped to obtain information about their salaries, locations, company names and job descriptions. The job descriptions were used to create various dummy variables highlighting whether certain keywords were present. Together with the location information, these variables were then used to predict whether a job listings' salaries would be above or below median.
